I am currently working as a researcher with the Department of Chemical Engineering at <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu" target="_blank">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a>. I am working for the project "Intelligent use of data to build optimization tools for cyber-physical systems in the process industry ([IKTPLUSS](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwja873q-fbvAhWJl4sKHeCzAFYQFjABegQICxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forskningsradet.no%2Fom-forskningsradet%2Fpublikasjoner%2F2018%2Fprogramplan-gjelder-fra-2018%2F&usg=AOvVaw0rUxeyGw9JisQDuPEnuNU7))" which is funded by the [Research Council of Norway](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/).


My work is to explore and develop methods such that physics/domain knowledge can be injected into the machine learning models. My current research aims to develop methods for understanding how black-box models make their predictions and what are their limitations. As the major for my master's was biomedical engineering, I am always keen to work in integrating machine learning and biomedical applications for smart systems.

Before joining NTNU, I was a post graduate trainee at [Aker Solutions](https://www.akersolutions.com), Pune.I have done my master's in Biomedical Engineering, from [College of Engineering, Pune](https://www.coep.org.in). My master's theses was supervised by [Dr. Dayaram Sonawane](http://www.coepembeddedlab.com/sonawane.html) and my theses topic was "*Learning Based Model Predictive Control for Closed Loop Control of Anesthesia*". In the first year of my master's, I have extensively worked with the mathematical modeling of linear and nonlinear systems, implementing control strategies on embedded devices, performing HIL for verification process and testing the controller stability and performance. I was associated with the [Embedded Systems Lab](http://www.coepembeddedlab.com). My publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUQxY7QAAAAJ&hl=en) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saket-Adhau). In my free time, I listen to music or watch movies.
