I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu" target="_blank">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a>. 


My work is to explore and develop methods such that physics/domain knowledge can be injected into the machine learning models. My current research aims to develop methods for understanding how black-box models make their predictions and what are their limitations. As the major for my master's was biomedical engineering, I am always keen to work in integrating machine learning and biomedical applications for smart systems.

Before joining NTNU, I was a post graduate trainee at [Aker Solutions](https://www.akersolutions.com), Pune. sI have done my master's in Biomedical Engineering, from [College of Engineering, Pune](https://www.coep.org.in). My master's theses was supervised by [Dr. Dayaram Sonawane](http://www.coepembeddedlab.com/sonawane.html) and my theses topic was "*Learning Based Model Predictive Control for Closed Loop Control of Anesthesia*". In the first year of my master's, I have extensively worked with the mathematical modeling of linear and nonlinear systems, implementing control strategies on embedded devices, performing HIL for verification process and testing the controller stability and performance. I was associated with the [Embedded Systems Lab](http://www.coepembeddedlab.com). My publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUQxY7QAAAAJ&hl=en) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saket-Adhau). In my free time, I listen to music or watch movies.
