I am currently a PhD student at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.ntnu.edu" target="_blank">NTNU</a>), Trondheim, Norway. My current research aims to develop methods for understanding how black-box models make their predictions and what are their limitations. 

Before joining NTNU, I was a post graduate trainee at [Aker Solutions](https://www.akersolutions.com), Pune. I have done my master's from [College of Engineering, Pune](https://www.coep.org.in). My master's theses was supervised by [Dr. Dayaram Sonawane](http://www.coepembeddedlab.com/sonawane.html) and my theses topic was "*Learning Based Model Predictive Control for Closed Loop Control of Anesthesia*". In the first year of my master's, I have extensively worked with the mathematical modeling of linear and nonlinear systems, implementing control strategies on embedded devices, performing HIL for verification process and testing the controller stability and performance. I was associated with the [Embedded Systems Lab](http://www.coepembeddedlab.com). My publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUQxY7QAAAAJ&hl=en) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saket-Adhau). In my free time, I listen to music or watch movies.
