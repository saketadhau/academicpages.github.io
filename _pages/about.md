I am a Machine learning research assistant at [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu) with the Department of Chemical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Sigurd Skogestad. While working in machine learning-based approaches for approximating Model Predictive Control, most of the time I was unable to explain the behavior of the black box models. This led me to work in exploring and developing methods such that physics/domain knowledge can be injected into the machine learning models. My current research aims to develop methods for understanding how black-box models make their predictions and what are their limitations. As the major for my master's was biomedical engineering, I am always keen to work in integrating machine learning and biomedical applications for smart systems.
